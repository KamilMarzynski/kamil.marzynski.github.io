# Personal Blog

This is my personal blog. I am writing here about GenAI programming mostly as I recently decided to jump into this field.
Blogs will be both technical and less technical ones. Mostly I will review them and improve writing using AI tools, but stories and ideas will be mine.
For now this blog will be markdown files only, but if I will be consistent enough I may consider moving to a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo in the future.
